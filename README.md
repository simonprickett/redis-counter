Counting with Redis, a Raspberry Pi with TM1637 7 segment display and a web interface.  Code in Python and Node.js.

This project was created as part of my [Things on Thursdays](https://simonprickett.dev/things-on-thursdays-livestreams/) IoT livestreaming series for Redis.  Check out the videos for this project below:
