# Redis Counter Project

Counting with Redis, a Raspberry Pi with TM1637 7 segment display and a web interface.  Code in Python and Node.js.  

![Screenshot of the completed project](redis_counter_pi_project.png)

The aim of this project is to demonstrate how the current value of the count, stored in Redis, can be displayed and updated simultaneously from multiple displays.  I demonstrate using multiple instances of a web interface, plus the 7 segment display and an arcade button attached to a Raspberry Pi.

This project was created as part of my [Things on Thursdays](https://simonprickett.dev/things-on-thursdays-livestreams/) IoT livestreaming series for Redis.  Check out the videos for this project below:
